bookmark.it
===========

It's Friday night, 12:20AM . I'm a bit of OCD when it comes to my bookmarks. I have more than 1000+ bookmarks with intersting [articles, tools, tutorials, etc] that I like to re-visit sometimes, therefore I bookmark it.

Sure, there are services like Google, Discuss and whatnot that can do it for me. But they look overbloated with fancy features and I'm also concerned about my privacy. What I want is something simple, plain and no extra useless features, I just want to save my bookmark and add some labels within a nice container. I also wanted to be able to search them, you know, in case I need to re-read it.

So, here my task list:

- [] Add Bookmark
- [] Date I added the bookmark
- [] [maybe] A short description
- [] Add Labels
- [] Search Bookmarks

I will use Rails as my back-end, and I'll use this opportunity to get familiarized with AngularJS for the front-end.

Tools I'll use straight away:

``` Since this is be aimed at Developers I will use HTML5 and CSS3 quite a lot. I'm also going to use this opportunity to learn about flex-box and stuff like that ```

Back End
- Ruby
- Rails

Functionality
- Elastic Search for Searching
- Devise for Authentication

Front End
- HTML5
- CSS3
- AngularJS
